# janus
**Janus** is a next-generation **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** and **Zero Trust** platform designed for multi-tenant, federated environments. Inspired by the Roman god of gateways, Janus acts as the **Gatekeeper** between users, services, and data â€” enforcing trust boundaries with precision.
